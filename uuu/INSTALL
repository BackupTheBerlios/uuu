Uuu build instructions
----------------------

If you have not done so, aquire the toolchain module from CVS. This contains
tools required by the build environment of Uuu itself. At a minimum,
mkuuubimage is required.

If you would like to manipulate or install Uuu on udbfs (which is the default;
the alternative is to use GRUB, described below), you will also need mkudbfs
and udbfstools. Udbfslib need not be installed; the tool in the toolchain
depend on it, but will find it in the CVS tree by default.


Once the standard toolchain is installed, simply running 'make' should create a
file 'diskimage' that is a 1.44MB floppy image. This can either be used as a
disk image by bochs, or written to a disk like so:

  dd if=diskimage of=/dev/FLOPPYDEVICE

If you would like to use GRUB to boot unununium, run instead 'make grub'. This
will create an ELF file sys/bootloader/x86/stage2 that is multiboot compliant
and can be simply booted with GRUB with its 'kernel' command. This enables one
to boot Unununium from any filesystem GRUB can read.
